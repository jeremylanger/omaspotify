# Changelog

## Unreleased

OmaSpotify is a fork of [Omarchy Spotify](https://github.com/stappmus/Omarchy-Spotify).
Changes below start from the fork point. For the history of the original plugin, see
[its changelog](https://github.com/stappmus/Omarchy-Spotify/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- Removed dead code: the unused `ArtistSearchSection` component, the `patches/`
  directory, and a duplicate copy of a screenshot shipped as `preview.png`.
- Shrank the documentation screenshots from 3200px to 1600px wide.
- Lint every source file by glob so a new one is never missed.
- Run the test suite in CI on every push and pull request.
